**Step 6: Compilation and Testing**

To compile and test your library and scripts, follow these steps:

1. Run `./build_libmy.sh` to compile your library.

2. Run individual Bash scripts (e.g., `./use_putchar.sh`) to test
the library functions.

3. Ensure that your library functions work correctly, and your Bash
scripts execute without errors.

4. Commit all your files to your repository and push them to your remote
repository.

Remember to adhere to the Betty style guidelines throughout the process.
